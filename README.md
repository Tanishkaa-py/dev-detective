🕵️ #Dev Detective – GitHub Profile Finder

Dev Detective is a responsive web application that allows users to search for any GitHub profile and view detailed information in a clean, modern interface. The app fetches real-time data from the GitHub Public API and presents it in a user-friendly profile card layout.

This project was built to strengthen core frontend concepts such as API integration, asynchronous JavaScript, error handling, and dynamic DOM manipulation.
